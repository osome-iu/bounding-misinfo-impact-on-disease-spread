## Software details and dependencies

We used Python 3.9.8 for all data cleaning and analysis.

Package dependencies are saved in the `requirements.txt` file saved in this directory.

After confirming that you have the correct version of Python (`python -V`), as well as the correct version of `pip` installed (running `pip -V` from the command line should display `pip 21.2.4` followed by a path), you should be able to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all of the necessary dependencies for this project.
